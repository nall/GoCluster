# Working with Codex in `gocluster`

Audience: the human operator working with Codex. For Codex's executor-facing rules, use `AGENTS.md`.

Use two layers:

- Use planning conversation to settle intent, scope, risks, and edge cases.
- Use `AGENTS.md` as the compact execution contract once you want implementation to start.

`AGENTS.md` intentionally stays short so it can be kept in context. Its
Document Map points to the detailed workflow, code-quality, validation, review,
decision-memory, and command rules.

## Start in planning by default

Start with planning for anything that is not clearly a small localized fix. In this repo, that should be the default whenever the change may touch:

- concurrency, goroutine lifecycle, deadlines, shutdown, backpressure, or queues
- telnet or packet protocol behavior, parsing, or compatibility
- hot paths, fan-out, p99, or memory bounds
- shared interfaces, multiple packages, operator-visible behavior, or rollout decisions

Recommended prompt:

```text
Plan only. Inspect the current code, identify risks and edge cases, and produce a decision-complete approach. Do not implement yet.
```

For config, YAML, loader, or defaulting work, ask Codex to include a
`Config Contract Audit`. The audit should show which YAML files are touched,
which loader owns them, how missing/null/zero/false values behave, and which
runtime consumers were checked for re-defaulting.

## Skip long planning only for clearly small work

You can usually go straight to implementation only when the change is tightly localized and all of these are true:

- no protocol or compatibility change
- no concurrency, lifecycle, timeout, queue, or shutdown impact
- no shared-component or cross-package contract change
- no user-visible behavior change beyond a strictly local fix

If the blast radius expands, reclassify it as Non-trivial immediately.

## Switch to implementation when scope is stable

Move from planning to execution only when:

1. The intended behavior and architecture are stable.
2. You are ready to approve the implementation scope.

For Non-trivial work, the handoff point is the Scope Ledger. Ask Codex to present `Proposed Scope Ledger vN`, then approve it with:

```text
Approved vN
```

No code, diffs, or full validation should happen before that approval.
Before that ledger, Codex should inspect the relevant current code path so the scope is grounded in actual entry points, state, tests, and user-visible behavior.
The proposed ledger should also include a `Reasoning budget` recommendation.
Use it as Codex's target reasoning-level suggestion for the next execution turn;
it does not approve scope or waive validation.

## Practical loop

1. Ask for plan-only analysis.
2. Review the risks, edge cases, and proposed approach.
3. Ask for `Proposed Scope Ledger vN` for the agreed change.
4. Reply `Approved vN`.
5. Let Codex execute under `AGENTS.md`, including validation and documentation duties.

If you only want explanation or review of existing code, say that explicitly and keep the request non-mutating.
