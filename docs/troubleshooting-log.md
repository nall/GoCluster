# Troubleshooting Log

This index tracks troubleshooting records (`TSR-XXXX`) that can lead to ADRs.

## How To Use
- Create new troubleshooting records in `docs/troubleshooting/` using `TSR-TEMPLATE.md`.
- Add one row per TSR to the table below.
- If a TSR results in a durable decision, add/create the ADR and cross-link both records.
- Do not delete old TSR rows; mark status updates in place.
