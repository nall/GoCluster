# Pprof Impact Review

Use this skill for repo-local performance evidence review when multiple profile bundles exist and the user wants to know whether a change helped, regressed, or only partially succeeded.

## Required workflow

1. Build the bundle ledger first.
   - List available bundles chronologically.
   - Identify capture timestamps, binary build timestamps when present, and likely restart boundaries.
   - Classify each bundle as `cold`, `warm`, or `transition`.

2. Inspect the standard profile set.
   - Run `go tool pprof -top` for:
     - CPU
     - mutex
     - heap (`inuse_space`)
     - allocs (`alloc_space`)
     - block when blocking behavior is part of the question
   - Prefer the actual bundle files in `logs/` over assumptions.

3. Compare the target symbols explicitly.
   - Extract exact before/after numbers for the functions the user cares about.
   - Separate:
     - cold-start vs warm-runtime
     - startup/load costs vs steady-state costs
     - `alloc_space` vs `inuse_space`
     - repo-owned costs vs dependency/platform/runtime noise

4. Produce the judgment.
   - State whether the round was:
     - net positive
     - net negative
     - mixed / partially successful
   - If one hotspot was removed and a larger one was introduced, say that directly and re-rank the next target accordingly.
   - Include a confidence level and the reason for any downgrade.

## Output expectations

- Use absolute timestamps.
- Mention process age or restart context when it affects interpretation.
- Do not claim runtime confirmation from microbenchmarks alone.
- If live comparability is weak, say so plainly.

## Default command pattern

Typical commands:
- `go tool pprof -top logs/cpu-<stamp>.pprof`
- `go tool pprof -top logs/mutex-<stamp>.pprof`
- `go tool pprof -top logs/heap-<stamp>.pprof`
- `go tool pprof -top -sample_index=alloc_space logs/allocs-<stamp>.pprof`

Use focused `Select-String` or equivalent filtering when comparing specific symbols across bundles.
