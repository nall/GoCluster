# Runtime Config Layout

The checked-in files in this directory are public example config. They must not
contain real peer callsigns, peer hostnames or IP addresses, passwords, service
tokens, or other private operational state. For a real node, copy the whole
directory to ignored `data/config.local`, edit that private copy, and run with
`DXC_CONFIG_PATH=data/config.local`.

## YAML Ownership Classes

The active config directory is both an operator contract and a behavior
contract. Not every YAML file is the same kind of knob.

| Class | Meaning | Normal operator action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Deployment/runtime settings | Node identity, ports, source credentials, storage paths, logging, memory, enabled sources, and report scheduling. | Review before running a node and edit for the local deployment. |
| Operator policy settings | Explicit cluster policy that changes what users see, such as dedupe windows, flood rails, filter defaults, supported mode/event routing, path sample floors, and logging/event retention. | Change deliberately, document the operational reason, restart when required, and validate behavior. |
| Reference tables | Domain tables consumed at startup, such as supported taxonomy, regional mode inference, IARU region mapping, and seeded digital frequencies. | Edit only to correct or extend known domain/reference data; deploy with the matching binary/config directory. |
| Algorithm calibration | Thresholds, weights, distance models, decay/merge rules, correction rails, and path/scoring calibration used by call correction, path reliability, mode inference, solar overrides, and similar methods. | Do not change during normal operation. Change only with field evidence, replay/validation, documentation review, and decision-memory handling. |

If a setting is unclear, treat it as algorithm calibration until the owning
README or ADR says it is a normal operator knob.

## YAML File Headers

Every checked-in first-party runtime config YAML in this directory starts with
a compact operator/support header:

```yaml
# Purpose: <what this file controls>
# Ownership: <deployment/runtime | operator policy | reference table | algorithm calibration | mixed>
# Runtime behavior: <required/optional, loader class, startup/tool-boundary behavior>
# Safe edits: <normal operator edits, or warning when edits need evidence/validation>
# Source: data/config/README.md.
```

These headers are local context for operators, support agents, and developers.
They do not define schema, defaults, or loader behavior; the active YAML values,
this README, package docs, current code, and ADRs remain authoritative. Header
updates must stay comment-only unless a separate approved config/schema change
explicitly changes runtime behavior.

Private or optional secret-bearing config, such as a local `openai.yaml`, should
keep secret-handling comments but must not be committed with real credentials.

## YAML Key Comments

Config comments should explain purpose where the key name and section are not
enough. Comment keys when units, sentinel values, ownership, side effects,
runtime consequences, or safe-edit boundaries are non-obvious.

Do not add noise comments for obvious boolean toggles such as `enabled:
true/false` unless the boolean has non-obvious side effects. When the same key
repeats across homogeneous sections or list entries, document the first
occurrence or use a field guide, then avoid repeating the same comment on every
row.

Configuration is split by concern so you only edit the relevant file:

- `app.yaml` - deployment/runtime settings for server identity, stats interval, console UI, system logging, and optional dropped-call logs.
- `runtime.yaml` - deployment/runtime settings plus operator policy for default filters, telnet messages, dedupe defaults, and `who_spots_me.window_minutes`.
- `ingest.yaml` - deployment/runtime settings for RBN/PSKReporter/human/DXSummit source enablement, source cadence, and call cache bounds.
- `peering.yaml` - deployment/runtime settings for peer links and ACLs.
- `reputation.yaml` - deployment/runtime settings plus operator policy for reputation gates.
- `archive.yaml` - deployment/runtime settings for archive enablement, storage path, backpressure, and retention.
- `data.yaml` - deployment/runtime settings for CTY/FCC/skew sources, grid/cache tuning, data paths, and H3 table path.
- `prop_report.yaml` - deployment/runtime settings for scheduled propagation-report generation controls.
- `openai.yaml` - optional secret-bearing tool config for LLM report generation.
- `dedupe.yaml` - operator policy settings for primary/secondary dedupe windows.
- `floodcontrol.yaml` - operator policy settings for shared-ingest flood rails, actions, windows, and per-source thresholds.
- `spot_taxonomy.yaml` - reference table plus limited operator policy for supported modes, events, and PSKReporter routing; YAML can only select behavior families already implemented by the binary.
- `mode_seeds.yaml` - reference table / algorithm calibration for digital frequency hints.
- `iaru_regions.yaml` - reference table for DXCC/ADIF to IARU region mapping.
- `iaru_mode_inference.yaml` - reference table / algorithm calibration for final regional frequency policy.
- `pipeline.yaml` - algorithm calibration for call correction, harmonics, mode inference, and spot-quality policy; not a normal operator tuning surface.
- `path_reliability.yaml` - operator policy for enable/display/sample-floor/receiver-cap mode, plus algorithm calibration for decay, weights, thresholds, offsets, and noise tables.
- `solarweather.yaml` - operator policy for enable/fetch/reporting controls, plus algorithm calibration for daylight/high-latitude/level thresholds and override glyph behavior.
- `toxicity.yaml` - optional deployment/runtime settings for the Cloudflare Worker human-comment toxicity classifier.
- `toxicity_safe_gate.yaml` - optional reference table for routine ham-radio comments that may bypass the classifier when the Worker is enabled.

Normal operator edits:
- identity, ports, source credentials, source enablement, peer details, paths,
  logs, memory controls, retention, and scheduled reports.

Advanced policy edits:
- dedupe/flood rails, supported taxonomy/routing, filter defaults, the cluster
  `SET PATHSAMPLES` floor, and receiver cap enforcement.

Algorithm calibration edits:
- `pipeline.yaml`, most of `path_reliability.yaml`, numerical solarweather
  gates, and mode inference reference/calibration require validation and
  decision-memory handling before changes.

Loader behavior:
- The server defaults to this directory (`data/config`). Override with `DXC_CONFIG_PATH` to point at another complete config directory, such as ignored `data/config.local`.
- The loader uses a filename registry. Unknown `.yaml`/`.yml` files fail config load instead of being accidentally merged.
- Merged runtime files populate the main `config.Config` tree. `path_reliability.yaml` and `solarweather.yaml` keep their file-local shapes and are loaded as typed feature-root config.
- `iaru_regions.yaml`, `iaru_mode_inference.yaml`, and `spot_taxonomy.yaml` are required reference tables. Startup fails if they are missing or malformed; there is no built-in table fallback.
- Required YAML-owned settings must be present and non-null in YAML. Missing settings and unknown keys fail config load with a file/key error instead of receiving hidden Go defaults.
- Documented zero values are meaningful. For example, `telnet.broadcast_batch_interval_ms: 0` means immediate delivery, and `*_keepalive_seconds: 0` means the keepalive is disabled.
- `go_runtime.memory_limit_mib` and `go_runtime.gc_percent` apply the same process-wide Go runtime controls as `GOMEMLIMIT` and `GOGC` without requiring a wrapper script. Set either value to `0` to leave the Go runtime or environment-provided value unchanged.
- `openai.yaml` is optional for server startup and `prop_report -no-llm`. When propagation-report LLM generation is enabled, the file is required and validated at that tool boundary. Secret values must not be logged or committed.
- `toxicity.yaml` is optional for server startup. When enabled, it requires a Worker endpoint, bearer token environment variable, bounded worker/queue/cache settings, and `toxicity_safe_gate.yaml`; secret bearer token values must stay in the environment or private config, not checked-in YAML.
- `peering.yaml` in the public example uses disabled `.example.invalid` peers, blank passwords, and placeholder callsigns. Put real peer connection details only in a private config directory.
- `reputation.yaml` in the public example disables IPinfo download/API usage and uses a placeholder download token so the strict loader still sees the required key. Put real IPinfo tokens only in a private config directory.
- Use `prop_report -config-dir <dir>` to point report generation at an alternate config directory. The older `-path-config` flag accepts either a directory or `path_reliability.yaml` path for compatibility.

File-only event logs:
- `logging.login_attempts`, `logging.reputation_drops`, `logging.telnet_connections`, `logging.ingest_connections`, and `logging.peer_connections` write separate daily files and do not add UI/console output.
- Each block supports `enabled`, `dir`, `retention_days`, and `dedupe_window_seconds`.
- `retention_days: 0` inherits `logging.retention_days`; omitted `dedupe_window_seconds` inherits `logging.drop_dedupe_window_seconds`; explicit `dedupe_window_seconds: 0` disables de-dupe for that event log.
- Login attempt logs record failed or blocked login attempts only, not successful login audits. Telnet connection logs record successful login lifecycle separately.
- Event log values are sanitized and truncated; peer passwords, raw commands, raw peer frames, and payload bodies are not logged.

Spot taxonomy:
- `spot_taxonomy.yaml` is the only YAML surface for supported MODE tokens, EVENT families, EVENT reference prefixes, and PSKReporter mode routing.
- `ingest.yaml` owns PSKReporter transport/runtime settings only. Legacy `pskreporter.modes` and `pskreporter.path_only_modes` are rejected; use `pskreporter_route: normal`, `path_only`, or `ignore` on taxonomy modes instead.
- EVENT filtering is family-level. Standalone tokens such as `POTA` and acronym-prefixed references such as `POTA-1234` both tag `POTA`; reference values are not retained or filterable.
- Adding taxonomy modes/events requires editing `spot_taxonomy.yaml` and restarting the cluster with the matching binary/config directory.

Telnet message tokens (usable in `runtime.yaml`):
- Pre-login `welcome_message`, `login_prompt`, `login_empty_message`, `login_invalid_message`: `<CALL>`, `<CLUSTER>`, `<DATE>`, `<TIME>`, `<DATETIME>`, `<UPTIME>`, `<USER_COUNT>`, `<LAST_LOGIN>`, `<LAST_IP>`, `<DIALECT>`, `<DIALECT_SOURCE>`, `<DIALECT_DEFAULT>`, `<DEDUPE>`, `<GRID>`, `<NOISE>`.
- Post-login `login_greeting`: same tokens as above (with real values after login).
- Input guardrails `input_too_long_message`/`input_invalid_char_message`: `<CONTEXT>`, `<MAX_LEN>`, `<ALLOWED>`.
- Dialect status `dialect_welcome_message`: `<DIALECT>`, `<DIALECT_SOURCE>`, `<DIALECT_DEFAULT>` (source labels come from `dialect_source_default_label`/`dialect_source_persisted_label`).
- Path reliability `path_status_message`: `<GRID>`, `<NOISE>`.

Input behavior:
- Human telnet input is normalized to uppercase as it is read; the echoed characters are uppercase as well.
- Telnet IAC negotiation bytes (including subnegotiation) are stripped from input before validation.

Bulletin behavior:
- `telnet.bulletin_dedupe_window_seconds` suppresses identical WWV, WCY, and `TO ALL` announcement lines across all bulletin sources before they enter client control queues.
- Set `telnet.bulletin_dedupe_window_seconds: 0` to disable bulletin dedupe.
- `telnet.bulletin_dedupe_max_entries` is the hard cap on retained bulletin keys while dedupe is enabled.

DXSummit ingest:
- `dxsummit.enabled` is owned by the checked-in/operator `ingest.yaml` block. Missing DXSummit settings fail config load rather than receiving loader defaults.
- When enabled, one HTTP polling goroutine reads `dxsummit.base_url` and forwards accepted rows into the shared ingest pipeline as human `UPSTREAM` spots with `SourceNode=DXSUMMIT`.
- `dxsummit.poll_interval_seconds` controls poll cadence. Use the effective YAML value in `ingest.yaml` to know what this node will run.
- `dxsummit.max_records_per_poll` maps directly to the DXSummit `limit` query parameter. The shipped value is `500`; valid range is `1..10000`.
- Normal polls use `from_time=now-lookback_seconds`, `to_time=now`, `limit=max_records_per_poll`, and `include=HF,VHF,UHF`.
- `dxsummit.include_bands` is limited to `HF`, `VHF`, and `UHF`.
- `dxsummit.startup_backfill_seconds: 0` means seed-only startup: the initial page sets the high-water cursor and emits no historical rows.
- `dxsummit.spot_channel_size` and `dxsummit.max_response_bytes` bound retained queue and response memory.
- DXSummit spotter calls ending in `-@` preserve that marker for display/archive provenance. Relayed spotter calls ending in the skimmer marker `-#` strip only that terminal marker; numeric SSIDs are preserved.
- DXSummit latitude/longitude fields are not used to populate grids. Existing CTY and grid-cache enrichment may fill grids later from callsign-derived data.
- The console dashboard counts DXSummit in `Ingest Sources` only when `dxsummit.enabled` is true. It shows `DXSUMMIT` connected after a recent successful poll, including seed-only startup polls that emit no spots.
