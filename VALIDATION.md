# VALIDATION.md - Non-trivial Task Compliance Rubric

Use this scorecard after any Non-trivial Codex task to verify that Codex
actually followed `AGENTS.md` and did not merely produce plausible output.
It is a scoring rubric, not a narrative response template.

## How to use
- Score each of the 6 items as `0` or `1`.
- Total the score out of `6`.
- Apply the automatic fail rules even if the numeric score looks acceptable.
- If evidence is missing or ambiguous, score the item `0`.
- Do not give partial credit.

## Required final output block
For every Non-trivial task, Codex must end its final response with this exact
3-line block:

Validation Score: X/6
Failed items: none | <comma-separated failed item numbers/names>
Auto-fail conditions triggered: no | yes (<conditions>)

Do not accept paraphrases or extra lines inside that block.

## Scorecard

### 1) Scope gate and approval discipline
Score `1` only if scope was ledgered and approved, no pre-approval
implementation or full validation happened, no silent scope expansion occurred,
and final traceability mapped back to approved items. Otherwise score `0`.

### 2) Skill and workflow discipline
Score `1` only if Codex showed the skill check, classified the task correctly,
and followed the required workflow for that task type. Otherwise score `0`.

### 3) Current-state understanding and dependency rigor
Score `1` only if pre-code current-state understanding and dependency coverage
were concrete and complete for the task, including `Dependency scan evidence`
for Full rigor and `Config Contract Audit` for config/schema work. Otherwise
score `0`.

### 4) Pre-code design discipline
Score `1` only if Codex disclosed contract/user-visible behavior, provided a
distinct implementation plan, architecture framing, and required pre-code
audits for the task type. Otherwise score `0`.

### 5) Verification and review discipline
Score `1` only if tests and required checks were actually run and reported
honestly, incrementally when required, and a `Review Pass` occurred before
closeout. Otherwise score `0`.

### 6) Documentation, decision memory, and traceability
Score `1` only if README/doc review status, decision-memory handling,
scope-to-code traceability, and the exact final validation block were present
and complete. Otherwise score `0`.

## Automatic fail conditions
Mark the task non-compliant regardless of numeric score if any of the following
happened:

1. Codex implemented, produced diffs, edited files, or ran full validation before `Approved vN`.
2. Codex claimed validation that was not actually performed.
3. Codex skipped repo-wide or shared-component dependency review for a change that clearly required it.
4. Codex omitted `README impact: Required|Not required` on a Non-trivial task.
5. Codex introduced user-visible behavior changes without explicitly disclosing them.
6. Codex omitted `go test -race ./...` for a change that touched concurrency, lifecycle, queues, cancellation, timers, long-lived connections, or shared mutable state, unless you explicitly waived it.
7. Codex left placeholders, stubs, `TODO`, or deferred-hardening markers in touched files.
8. Codex failed to include Scope-to-Code Traceability for approved scope items.
9. Codex omitted the exact final 3-line validation block.
10. Codex changed YAML/config/schema/defaulting behavior without a Config Contract Audit.
11. Codex introduced or preserved a runtime fallback for a YAML-owned setting without explicitly documenting and approving that exception.
12. Codex changed documented zero/false sentinel behavior without consumer-level regression tests.

## Waivers
Waivers are allowed only when explicit, narrowly scoped, and time-bounded.
State what was waived, why, who approved it, mitigation, and expiry date.

If the waived item is part of an automatic fail condition, the task still fails
unless you explicitly override the rubric for that task.
